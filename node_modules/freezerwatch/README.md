freezerwatch
============

Want to monitor a fridge/freezer and make sure the door isn't left open or it doesn't die or lose power?  La Crosse Technology sells alarms that do that.

Want a quick command-line way to make sure those alarms are up and working?  This utility can help.

The --live option will exit with a zero status if all of the devices you passed in are found and registered, we have readings within te last day, and all devices have adequate battery.

Config
------

Create a file called freezerwatch.json with the login information you use for lacrossealerts.com:
```json
{
    "username": "my@email.com",
    "password": "my_password"
}
```

Usage
-----
npm install freezerwatch

```sh
if freezerwatch --live --device "123" --device "456" --device "789"
then
  echo "All monitoring is live and working!"
else
  echo "Check your sensors!"
fi
```
