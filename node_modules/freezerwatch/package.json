La Crosse Technology sells alarms that do that.\n\nWant a quick command-line way to make sure those alarms are up and working?  This utility can help.\n\nThe --live option will exit with a zero status if all of the devices you passed in are found and registered, we have readings within te last day, and all devices have adequate battery.\n\nConfig\n------\n\nCreate a file called freezerwatch.json with the login information you use for lacrossealerts.com:\n```json\n{\n    \"username\": \"my@email.com\",\n    \"password\": \"my_password\"\n}\n```\n\nUsage\n-----\nnpm install freezerwatch\n\n```sh\nif freezerwatch --live --device=\"123\" --device=\"456\" --device=\"789\"\nthen\n  echo \"All monitoring is live and working!\"\nelse\n  echo \"Check your sensors!\"\nfi\n```\n\nDevice IDs\n----------\n\nYou can find device IDs by logging into lacrossealerts.com/login and looking at the link that your 'Download' button points to.\n\nNote\n----\nLa Crosse Technology and La Crosse Alerts are registered trademarks of La Crosse Technology Ltd.
